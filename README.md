# ZBeat
ZBeat is a video caller assistant for the blind and visual unpaired people

ZBeat uses Microsoft’s Azure for a video assistance tool that helps blind people to understand other people’s mood in a videocall. It functions as an assistant(bot), which analyses the facial expression of the person talking, and translates it to a song that corresponds to a certain emotion.

We hope to enhance the video chatting experience for blind people, as well as friends and family, through the introduction of body language in their interactions.

## Usage
1. Open zbeat 
2. Open skype or any other video call software on the top of the desktop
3. Enjoy

A music will be played for each emotion (face expression) that is detected on screen
emotions avalailable:

"anger", "contempt", "disgust", "happiness", "neutral", "sadness", "surprise"
(customize your own sounds - MP3 inside DATA folder)
